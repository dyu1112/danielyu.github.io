Made in Unity. I worked on a team of 8 people to make this game in one weekend. I recorded and implemented all the sound effects for walking and for storing and removing items. I contributed the idea that the mother would be in the room, searching during the hiding process so the player would constantly have to be moving. I also came up with the idea of the light switch mechanic.

Entry to the MEGA Newbies and Vets Game Jam 2022 with the given theme constraint: "privacy." Awarded "Best Overall."

In the game, you play as a college student who must constantly move and hide their scandalous belongings to prevent your mother, who is actively searching for them, from finding them. The player can also turn off a light switch to temporarily distract the mother.
