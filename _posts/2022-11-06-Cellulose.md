Made in Unity. I worked on a team of 6 people to make this game in one weekend. I composed the soundtrack, creating 4 tracks total, with additional mixing in Audacity. I programmed the Lives and Score mechanics, as well as a Game Over state. I also implemented and programmed all of the UI, including HUD and menus. Within the settings menu, I also implemented a switch that allowed players to switch between 8-bit music and non-8-bit music.

I also debugged and created the 1.1 update, which fixed collision and menu issues.

Entry to the Open Alpha Game Jam 2022 with the given theme constraint: "mini." Awarded "Best Sound," "Best Design," and "Best Mechanics."

In the game, you play as Viri the virus. You can infect cells by entering their nuclei to take control of them to destroy other cells. The objective is to destroy as many cells as you can and survive as long as you can.
