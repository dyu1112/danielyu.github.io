In the game, the player must escape a house infested by creatures called Wards and Blinders. These creatures cast a curse upon the player when they are exposed to light, so the player must use their flashlight wisely to avoid them. To make their way around the house, the player must listen for audio cues that tell the player about the location of switches, doors, traps, medicine, and monsters.
