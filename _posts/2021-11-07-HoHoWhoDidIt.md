Made in Unity. I worked on a team of 7 people to make this game in one weekend. I composed the soundtrack, creating 7 tracks total. I also created sound effects for walking and pushing/pulling pieces. I came up with the initial idea of restoring pieces of memories of past events. I also contributed to the level design by suggesting that complete puzzles need not be perfectly square, thereby saving the art team time that would've otherwise been spent making 10 more puzzle pieces.

Entry to the MEGA Newbies and Vets Game Jam 2022 with the given theme constraint: "restore." Awarded "Best Audio."

Santa Claus has been murdered and the player must restore 3 pieces of evidence presented in the form of jigsaw-like puzzles to uncover Santa's murderer.
